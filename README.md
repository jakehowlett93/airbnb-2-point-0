Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This app is a clone of Airbnb made as a team of 4 as part of the Le Wagon bootcamp.

It uses the Rails framework and is hosted with a Postgres database.

I did some work in the controllers and models on the backend, and on the front end I made the majority of the bookings show page and others. Since the bootcamp I have done work on almost every page of the site in some way be it directly or through bug fixing.
